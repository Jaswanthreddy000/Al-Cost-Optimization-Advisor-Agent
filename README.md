## Overview

The AI Agent Orchestrator is an intelligent routing system that analyzes user queries and directs them to specialized sub-agents for optimal response generation. It serves as the central dispatcher that understands intent but delegates actual response generation to domain-specific agents.

## Key Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Precisely identifies user needs from queries
- **Smart Routing**: Directs requests to the most appropriate sub-agent
- **Response Synthesis**: Combines multi-agent outputs when needed
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new specialized agents

## Sub-Agent Ecosystem

### ü§ñ LLM Selection and Cost Comparison Agent

**Purpose**: Helps users select the optimal LLM and deployment architecture based on their specific requirements.

**Capabilities**:
- Compares LLMs across major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS)
- Evaluates 3 variants per provider (e.g., different model sizes)
- Provides detailed comparisons of:
  - Runtime duration
  - Monthly token costs
  - Tokens per dollar value
  - Response latency
  - Model quality ratings (1-10 scale)
- Recommends best options for:
  - Overall performance
  - Cost efficiency
  - Speed
  - Preferred balance

**Output Includes**:
- High-level deployment architecture suggestions
- Serverless vs containerized recommendations
- Caching strategies

### üí∏ Agent Cost Consumer Explainer Agent

**Purpose**: Explains token consumption patterns and cost-saving strategies for AI operations.

**Detailed Breakdown**:
- Token usage per action type:
  - Retrieval operations (RAG)
  - Long prompts vs short prompts
  - Tool/function calling
  - Streaming vs bulk output
  - Long context vs short context windows
- Credit/token consumption estimates per behavior
- Cost optimization strategies:
  - Prompt compression techniques
  - Function chaining approaches
  - Token limit configurations
  - Caching implementations

**Output Includes**:
- Behavior cost simulations
- Usage pattern analysis
- Token efficiency recommendations

### üìà ROI Calculator Agent

**Purpose**: Quantifies the financial impact of AI implementation for business stakeholders.

**Financial Analysis**:
- Compares manual process costs vs AI-powered costs
- Converts time savings into dollar values
- Incorporates model and infrastructure costs
- Generates comprehensive reports showing:
  - ROI percentage
  - Payback period
  - Net monthly/quarterly savings
  - Break-even timeline

**Recommendations Include**:
- Scaling guidance for pilot programs
- Identification of highest-ROI use cases
- Implementation priority suggestions

### ‚öôÔ∏è Business Automation Helper Agent

**Purpose**: Identifies automation opportunities across organizational functions.

**Departmental Analysis**:
- Evaluates automation potential in:
  - HR processes
  - Financial operations
  - Customer support
  - Sales workflows
  - Operational tasks
- Scores each use case by:
  - Implementation complexity
  - Cost-saving potential
  - LLM suitability (basic/advanced/generative needs)

**Output Includes**:
- Recommended pilot use cases
- Next-step routing suggestions
- Workflow automation blueprints

## System Architecture

The orchestrator follows a hub-and-spoke model:
1. User query enters the central Orchestrator
2. Intent analysis determines optimal sub-agent
3. Query routed to appropriate specialist agent
4. Agent response returned to Orchestrator
5. Final response delivered to user

For complex queries requiring multiple agents:
- Orchestrator coordinates parallel processing
- Synthesizes responses into unified answer
- Maintains response consistency

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Configure API keys and endpoints
4. Initialize the orchestrator service
5. Connect to frontend interface

## Usage Examples

**Scenario 1**: LLM Selection
- User query: "Need fastest LLM for real-time translations under $800/month"
- Routing: ‚Üí ü§ñ LLM Selection Agent
- Output: Model recommendations with latency/cost tradeoffs

**Scenario 2**: Cost Explanation
- User query: "Why are my function calls so expensive?"
- Routing: ‚Üí üí∏ Cost Explainer Agent
- Output: Token consumption breakdown + optimization tips

**Scenario 3**: Automation Planning
- User query: "Where can we automate in our accounting department?"
- Routing: ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Helper Agent
- Output: Prioritized list of automatable workflows
