      question: "How much can I really save on AI costs?",
      answer: "Most of our customers see 40-60% reduction in AI infrastructure costs within the first 3 months. The exact savings depend on your current setup, but our AI agents identify optimization opportunities across model selection, deployment strategies, and resource allocation."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your workflow builder different?",
      answer: "Our workflow builder uses intelligent AI agents that can automatically optimize your AI pipelines. Unlike traditional tools, it learns from your usage patterns and continuously suggests improvements while handling complex orchestration tasks automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support all major cloud providers?",
      answer: "Yes, we support AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and other major cloud providers. Our multi-cloud optimization ensures you get the best performance and pricing across different platforms."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer: "You can start seeing initial insights within minutes of connecting your systems. Significant cost optimizations typically begin showing within 1-2 weeks as our AI agents analyze your patterns and implement recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade encryption, comply with SOC 2 standards, and never store your sensitive data. All analysis happens in secure, isolated environments with strict access controls."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I integrate with existing tools?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer APIs and integrations with popular tools like Kubernetes, Docker, monitoring solutions, and CI/CD pipelines. Our team can help with custom integrations for enterprise customers."
